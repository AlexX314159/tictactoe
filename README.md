# tictactoe

This is a exploration of creating a tic tac toe game using python

To get started make sure you have the following installed.  

1. Python3 https://www.python.org/
2. Visual Studio Code  https://code.visualstudio.com/
3. Git https://git-scm.com/downloads  (if you're unfamiliar with git/github.  check out this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE&t=69s)

Currently the plan is to create a GUI base tic tac toe game that can be played in either single player or multiplayer mode.
